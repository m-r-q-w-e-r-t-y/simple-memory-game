Submitted by: **Anthony Mendez**

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

Link to project: (insert your link here, should start with https://glitch.com...)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [X] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [X] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [X] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [X] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [X] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [X] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons

* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
N/A. Did not use outside resources.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
Developing the `guess()` function was not as straight forward as I initially thought. After using console log to debug, I was able to get the solution working. I opted to use the solution provided. It was understandle and more concise than my implementation.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
My main question is how are companies able to keep track of so much code when making a product. Even for this project, 129 lines in the backend and even more for the frontend is a lot to keep track of. What are the methods that the industry uses to make coding easier to develop off of.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
What first comes to mind is that the ending message function could be refactored to display "You win" or "You lost". Also, I would add a functionaly that gives the user a random pattern to follow along with the option to increase the speed of the game. Finally, I would add even more CSS to make the web site have a more modern feel to it.
